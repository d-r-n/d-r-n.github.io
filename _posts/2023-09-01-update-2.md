There's beauty in transparency, right? Well, here it is anyway:

Building a company is fucking hard. But the kind of hard that energizes you and keeps you up at night devising ways to push through.

Let's start with the good. 

One of our biggest advantages as a technical founding team is that we can iterate super-fast. We were on full throttle the past weeks and our product has developed ten-fold. We optimized performance on data tasks and packaged our insight engine into a simple UI. 

Our customer is thrilled with how we've progressed. We finalized an annual contract with them, and we couldn't be more excited.

Now, the bad.

Sales has been really hard for us.

Our wise friend <a href="https://twitter.com/amit_ajwani" target="_blank">Amit</a> told us "Sales is only hard if you're bad at it." Ouch. <strong><sup>*</sup></strong>

Why we've been sucking at sales.

Leaning into production companies feels natural given our understanding of their pain points and data routines. We believe we can easily translate what we've built for our first customer to many more.

Once we thought we'd exhausted out immediate network, we turned to cold outreach. This was absolutely brutal. Despite our personalized messages and enthusiastic pitches, the response rate was 0%.

We licked our wounds and turned to a more refined strategy. We realized we hadn't even come close to exhausting our network. We just overlooked the potential of our connections. In other words, we were being dumb.

We tapped back into our connections for intros and the results speak for themselves. 90%+ response rate, 60% converted into meetings so far. Turns out the credibility that comes with an intro is a game changer.

Informed by this lesson, we're doubling down on this approach, dusting off old LinkedIn connections and hitting up alumni circles. And it‚Äôs paying off. We're in early-stage discussions with two $100M+ companies and one $100B+ company. We're not sure where these conversations will lead, but if there's one thing this journey has taught us, it's that agility and persistence invariably pay off.

Looking ahead, we anticipate September to be crammed with product iteration and sales hustling to hit our goals of 3 customers and $5k MRR.

This shit is hard, but damn I love it.

<strong><sup>*</sup></strong>Granted, it's only been a month. I'm a Bayesian, so I'll reevaluate our skills as we collect more data points.
