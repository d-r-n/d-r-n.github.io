Let's start with full transparency: I'm a co-founder of a startup that makes AI tools for film and TV development. That puts me in a unique, and admittedly conflicted, position in the ongoing debate about AI in the entertainment industry.

On one hand, I'm deeply invested in the potential of AI to enhance storytelling. On the other, I'm acutely aware of the fears and resistance within the industry. I've heard the concerns: "We don't want AI movies." But what exactly is an AI movie? And more importantly, what is a film?
This conflict is at the heart of why I'm writing this. I believe we need to have an honest conversation about what AI means for storytelling, free from both blind techno-optimism and reflexive fear.

I recently read a tweet from @kyalbr about what makes a script "undeniable." Among his criteria, one stands out: "The screenwriter clearly has some brilliant insight about humanity and is using the script to tell a story about it." This gets to the heart of what storytelling is about - not just in film, but across all mediums.

A film, like any form of storytelling, is a way to share human experiences and insights. It's about revealing some truth, some "incredible secret" about what it means to be human. This is what separates a mundane recounting of events from a story that captivates and moves us.
In June I had a chance encounter with Whoopi Goldberg at the Tribeca Film Festival. We got to chatting about AI and she told me “AI is nothing new in the industry. It's been here for 25 years.”

She's absolutely right. AI has been an integral part of filmmaking, often in ways we don't immediately recognize. It's in camera software that adjusts focus and lighting, in microphones that isolate dialogue from background noise, and in post-production suites that help create once-impossible worlds and characters.

These tools have made aspects of filmmaking more accessible, allowing indies to achieve effects once reserved for big-budget productions and giving established directors new ways to push boundaries. But here's the crucial point: none of these tools are telling the story. They're simply helping to capture and shape it. The story itself - that brilliant insight about humanity - still comes from the human mind and heart.

The dance between technology and human creativity isn't new. When cameras were invented, many painters thought photography wasn't art. Now that seems absurd. Everyone has a camera far better than what those painters were worried about, but we're not all famous photographers. There's something special about a great photo that we recognize when we see it, even if we can't explain it. We don't look at a powerful photograph and dismiss it because it's not a painting.

We're in a similar place with film and AI. New tools are emerging that could help more people bring their stories to life. If there's technology that makes it easier for people to tell stories, why wouldn't we embrace it?

In embracing these tools, we're not replacing human creativity - we're amplifying it. We're opening doors for voices that might otherwise go unheard, expanding our understanding of the human experience.

A great story is a great story, no matter how it's told. If you have a brilliant insight about humanity or an incredible truth to share, what's important is that you share it. The tools you use don't define the art. A brush doesn't make a painter, a lens doesn't make a photographer, and AI doesn't make a storyteller. These are just tools - the magic happens in how we use them.

If AI can help more people express their unique insights about humanity, isn't that worth exploring? Sure, easy to say, but there might be implications worth considering. How might AI change the way we tell stories?

The painters who initially dismissed photography couldn't have imagined how it would expand the artistic landscape. Photography ended up profoundly changing how painters worked, from more accurate depictions of motion (google “horse painting before photography”) to sparking new artistic movements like Impressionism.

As we explore how AI can be used in storytelling, we might ask: what new insights about humanity could this unlock? What fresh perspectives might it offer? But also, how might our storytelling evolve in response to AI, just as painting evolved in response to photography?

Perhaps the most important thing is to keep questioning, keep exploring, and stay open to the possibilities - and challenges - that lie ahead.
