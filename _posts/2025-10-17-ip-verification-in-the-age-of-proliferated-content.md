We’ve entered the era of infinite content. 

Anything you can think of can be produced instantly, endlessly, at a cost rapidly approaching free.

When anyone can create _anything_, they will. And much of that, will _belong to someone else_.

The digital content ecosystem is facing a crisis of scale. Generative AI has driven the cost of content creation to zero, unleashing a tidal wave of User-Generated Content (UGC) that is overwhelming platforms. This presents a legal and financial liability. Because generative models are trained on existing IP, they make it effortless for users to create and publish infringing derivative works. For social media, gaming, publishing, and enterprise platforms, the liability for hosting and monetizing this content is massive and untenable. Manual review is impossible. We need a system that bridges the legal, technical, and operational dimensions of intellectual property protection.

Imagine this. A platform (publisher) makes a simple API call to send content (text, image, audio) to a protocol. The protocol compares the content against a database of registered IP.

The protocol sends the platform guidance on how to handle any IP flagged in the content. What content it contains, if any, who owns it, how to handle the content ie, allow, block, micro-license, etc. based on the rules set by the IP holder.

This protocol would be the verification layer for the modern internet. It is a compliance-as-a-service utility that sits between a platform’s users and publication. Before any UGC goes live, it’s checked against the protocol.

The technology to build this is viable. The core asset is the comprehensiveness and trustworthiness of the IP database. The platform's success hinges on solving this "cold start" problem before a single line of code for the matching engine is written.

The first and most critical step would be to establish a foundational coalition of industry leaders in media, rights management, and creator estates. This coalition provides industry-wide social proof, seed capital, and the foundational data needed to make the system viable from day one.

With the coalition's backing, we launch a systematic, data-driven outreach program to build the most comprehensive IP library in the world.

We will use the U.S. Copyright Office's public catalog to identify and prioritize outreach to millions of registered rights holders.

Launch a multi-channel outreach campaign (email, direct mail, industry marketing), prominently featuring the logos and testimonials of our coalition partners. It will be free to claim, protect and monetize your IP in the protocol.

A secure, verified portal will allow rights holders to easily submit their work and set usage policies. We will be emphatic that we are storing secure hashes and vector embeddings, not the raw source material, ensuring their most valuable assets are never exposed.

The defensible moat is not the technology; it is our coalition-first strategy. With industry alignment from day one, we define the standard for how creative IP is verified and protected in the age of infinite content.
