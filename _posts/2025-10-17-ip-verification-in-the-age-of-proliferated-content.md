We’ve entered the era of infinite content. 

Anything you can think of can be produced instantly, endlessly, at a cost rapidly approaching free.

When anyone can create _anything_, they will. And much of that, will _belong to someone else_.

Every platform that hosts or monetizes this output is liable for IP infringement.

We need a protocol for verifying intellectual property.

That protocol is **Aegis**.

Aegis is the verification layer of the modern internet. It's a clearing house that sits between user-generated content and publication.

A platform sends an API call (text, image, audio, video).
Aegis compares it against a consolidated global database of registered IP.
It returns a structured response:

- Similarity score
- Ownership data
- Recommended action: allow, block, flag, or micro-license

Platforms reduce risk.
Creators retain control.
The internet stays open, legal, and scalable.

The technology to do this is not hard. Building the credibility to be trusted with IP is the hard part.

To build the world’s verification layer, you need the world’s rights holders to be on board.

We’re inviting the incumbents to the table.

- Major media conglomerates
- Rights management organizations
- Creator estates

These groups represent millions of works and billions in value. Their participation turns Aegis from a startup idea into an industry standard.

We use the U.S. Copyright Office catalog as our roadmap.
We reach out to every registered rights holder with a simple message:

**Protect your work. Join the protocol.**

Onboarding is frictionless. Verification is secure.
We don’t store your assets, only cryptographic hashes and vector embeddings.
Your IP stays private, your ownership stays provable.

Our advantage is not speed, our algorithms, or our data. It’s **alignment**.

IP holders need protection.
Platforms need verification.
Users need trust.

Aegis sits in the middle as the ownership and settlement layer for the age of infinite content.
