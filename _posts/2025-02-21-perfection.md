Over the past two years as a founder, I’ve learned that in building successful products, perfection is only necessary where it matters. 

Every task falls into one of two buckets:
- **Mission-critical problems**: These demand 100% accuracy. Think autonomous driving, medical diagnoses, or banking transactions.
- **Non-mission-critical problems**: For these, around 80% accuracy is typically good enough. Examples include generating recipes or writing blogs.

Building a perfect solution for non-critical tasks is a waste of time. At the same time, trying to get 99% accuracy on a mission-critical task is a fool’s errand. We wasted a ton of time building a 99% accurarate solution for a client who needed 100%—and they walked away.

Focus your effort on perfecting only mission critical things, and get everything else good enough to iterate later.
