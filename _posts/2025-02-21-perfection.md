**Perfection only matters when it matters.**

Every task fits in one of two buckets:

- **Mission-critical:** Needs 100% accuracy. Anything less fails. 
- **Non-critical:** 80% is good enough, 90% is great.

Chasing perfection in the wrong places wastes time. I have spent a lot of time chasing perfection in things where it doesn't matter. I probably had to, to understand.

Chasing perfection in the wrong places is wasted energy. Iâ€™ve done that plenty. Maybe I had to, to really understand this.
