When I was a grad student learning about artificial neural networks, our journey began Walter McCullough and Walter Pitts, the two computational neuroscientist who coined the term "neural network." Their work, deeply influenced by the brain's architecture and capabilities, sought to decode the process by which the brain generates complex thoughts and behaviors from relatively simple neural mechanisms. This led us to Frank Rosenblatt's development of the Perceptron, a groundbreaking a computational model designed to mimic how neurons process information in the brain.

The notion of using computational models to understand and mimic neural processing was fascinating. But it wasn't long before I was asking myself if artificial neural networks were conscious. This train of thought quickly morphed into images of humanoid robots powered by artificial neural networks, followed by thinking Terminator was a prescient depiction of the future. But as I dug deeper into my studies, it became clear that neural networks and the human brain, while they might share some conceptual similarities, are fundamentally different in their structure and functioning. This realization made me take a step back and think more critically about the common metaphor of AI as an artificial brain, leading me to reassess our perceptions and relationships with these technologies.

The common metaphor of AI as an artificial brain often leads people to think of AI as a machine with human-like consciousness. This is misleading and can obscure AI's true nature, sometimes even fostering unwarranted fears about sentient technology. A more accurate and less intimidating comparison is to see AI, particularly LLMs, as digital DNA – a set of complex instructions devoid of consciousness. DNA is a static code that does not inherently adapt to its environment. This static nature is mirrored in LLMs during their operational phase. Like DNA, LLMs don't spontaneously evolve; they function strictly within their programmed parameters.

Our advanced understanding of DNA, exemplified by breakthroughs like CRISPR, contrasts sharply with our more limited knowledge of the brain. The artificial brain metaphor, suggesting an enigmatic 'black box' akin to the brain's mysteries, might inadvertently limit our exploration and understanding of AI. It can lead to misconceptions that understandings the weights and functions of an AI model is as challenging as understanding the human brain. However, viewing AI as a set of instructions, akin to DNA, makes AI more approachable.

This reframing opens up exciting possibilities. Just as geneticists make targeted modifications to DNA, maybe a similar approach could be applied to LLMs. Imagine surgically updating an AI model's weights without the need for new data – that would revolutionize AI development.

Reimagining AI as digital DNA can help shift perception of AI from abstract, science fiction concepts to a concrete, understandable framework. This perspective acknowledges the complexity of AI while reframing it as an instrument of human creativity, rather than a threat to human agency.
