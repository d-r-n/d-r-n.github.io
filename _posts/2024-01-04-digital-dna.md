When I was a grad student learning about neural networks, I started with how McCullough and Pitts were influenced by the brain's structure and function. They aimed to understand how the brain could produce complex thoughts and behaviors from simple neural mechanisms. I then studied the Perceptron, a computational model designed to mimic how neurons process information. The concept of using computational models to understand and mimic neural processing was fascinating. I conjured images of humanoids that used neural networks to think like humans began to question if there actually was merit to the plot of Terminator. But as I learned more, I understood that neural networks and the human brain are fundamentally different in their structure and functioning and only conceptually similar. This understanding led me to reflect on the broader implications of the common metaphor of AI as an artificial brain, prompting a reevaluation of how we perceive and relate to these technologies.

The common metaphor of AI as an artificial brain often leads people to think of AI as a machine with human-like consciousness. This is misleading and can obscure AI's true nature, sometimes even fostering unwarranted fears about sentient technology. A more accurate and less intimidating comparison is to see AI, particularly LLMs, as digital DNA – a set of complex instructions devoid of consciousness. DNA is a static code that does not inherently adapt to its environment. This static nature is mirrored in LLMs during their operational phase. Like DNA, LLMs don't spontaneously evolve; they function strictly within their programmed parameters.

Our advanced understanding of DNA, exemplified by breakthroughs like CRISPR, contrasts sharply with our more limited knowledge of the brain. The artificial brain metaphor, suggesting an enigmatic 'black box' akin to the brain's mysteries, might inadvertently limit our exploration and understanding of AI. It can lead to misconceptions that grasping the weights and functions of an AI model is as challenging as unraveling the human mind's intricacies. However, viewing AI as a set of instructions, akin to DNA, demystifies its workings and makes the concept more approachable. This perspective could inspire groundbreaking approaches in AI similar to those in genetic editing.

This reframing opens up exciting possibilities. Just as geneticists make targeted modifications to DNA, maybe a similar approach could be applied to LLMs. Imagine surgically updating an AI model's weights without the need for new data – that would revolutionize AI development.

Reimagining AI as digital DNA can help shift perception of AI from abstract, science fiction concepts to a concrete, understandable framework. This perspective acknowledges the complexity of AI while reframing it as an instrument of human creativity, rather than a threat to human agency.
